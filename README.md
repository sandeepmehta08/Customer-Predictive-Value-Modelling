# Customer-Predictive-Value-Modelling

This project focuses on exploring customer purchasing behavior using the [Online Retail II dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci/data) . It aims to understand how different products, customers, and countries contribute to overall sales. The analysis includes cleaning the transactional data, performing exploratory data analysis, and identifying key patterns such as top-selling products and the most profitable regions.

By examining purchase quantities, total spending, and basic sales trends, the project provides insights into which categories perform well and which markets dominate the store’s revenue. This forms a solid foundation for later work in customer segmentation, predictive modelling, and business strategy development.
